<!-- Selectors priority and specifics: inline styling is
with the most priority: 1000 points. Then comes id with 100,
class with 10 and elements(tags) with 1 point. It is
important to know which combination of selectors holds the
highest value, in order to be able to use them efficiently. -->

<!-- For the structure, we have a few tags that greatly help
us shape the page:
header, loads first and has important information on it;
nav, which lets us create navigation bars;
main, which holds everything that is not of a particular type;
aside, for creating sidebars;
footer for creating lines at the bottom of the page with other, less
important information on them.
In short a page can be divided into three sections: 
header, main and footer. -->
