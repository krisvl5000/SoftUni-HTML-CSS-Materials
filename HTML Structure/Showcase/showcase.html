<!-- Selectors priority and specifics: inline styling is
with the most priority: 1000 points. Then comes id with 100,
class with 10 and elements(tags) with 1 point. It is
important to know which combination of selectors holds the
highest value, in order to be able to use them efficiently. -->

<!-- For the structure, we have a few tags that greatly help
us shape the page:
header, loads first and has important information on it;
nav, which lets us create navigation bars;
main, which holds everything that is not of a particular type;
aside, for creating sidebars;
footer for creating lines at the bottom of the page with other, less
important information on them.
In short a page can be divided into three sections: 
header, main and footer. We can use section to further divide the elements
into smaller, more manageable segments. -->

<!-- Other useful elements are article, used mostly for magazines,
blog posts and other similar needs.
The figure tag is used for pages, where an image with a caption is needed
(written withing the figcaption attribute), as in the example below. -->

<!-- Other useful tags are details and summary, used to provide
additional information aboutr something, and time and address,
which are used to represent time that is readable both for the user and
the browser, making the page easier to use and more intuitive. -->
